This is the beginning of a teaching app for Ruby on Rails, with HTML through.
Log in capability has been set up, and only logged-in users can add questions and answers. And only an admin can add them to the app.
The next task will be setting up the rest of the topics, and getting better questions and answers, which will be sourced from other teachers and sites.

This application uses Rails 4.0.0
Testing was done with specs and pry tests.
Foundation was added for CSS styling, but not altered much for improvement. That is another thing which will be improved.
